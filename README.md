### 🏫 Hotel Card

In this project we have tried to manipulate Dom elements, Styling using CSS and tried to make website more dynamic and responsive. With our  efforts and the technology that we have learned in Unit-3 in the Masai School, we were able to clone the website in 5 days with the same looking and some features.

### End Notes 📑

In this project we have tried to achieve like the  original design as much as possible. This entire journey of this Unit-3 construct week has given us experiences and we have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence. Most of the features are added and functionality of the website is achieved by dom manipulation.

### Limitations

Pages are not fully responsive yet, those pages might not be properly visible on small screen devices as we were given only 5 days to clone the website.
